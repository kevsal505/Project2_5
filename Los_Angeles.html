<div class ="box"><img src="Los_Angeles1.png"></div>
<p>The first group of people to ever explore the area of what is known as Los Angeles were the Native American
tribes Chumash and Tongva.It wasn't until 1781, when the Spanish came over and settled in the area. Mexico would
later take ownership of the city after they gained independence from Spain.It would later be given to the US where
it would be declared an offical city in 1847.
</p><br>
<p>Los Angeles would soon grow to be the 2nd most populated American city accoring to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/"> Britannica </a> with about
3.8 million people living there. LA is a multicultral city with alot of interesting neighborhoods offering you a glimpse into different cultures such 
as Koreatown, Boyle heights, and Chinatown. If you want more information on these parts of Los Angeles check at the bottom half of this webpage.
A big reason to check out Los Angeles is the variation of all the different foods you can eat within the city. When you're walking down the street in just about any part of town,
you can find a Chinese resturant, not to far away from an Indian resturant or a Mexican resturant. Some of the local favorites include In-n-out and King Taco.
If you are fan of cinema you can check out the TCL Chinese theather located in Hollywood Blvd or visit Universal Studios which is an entire theme park
based on movies.
