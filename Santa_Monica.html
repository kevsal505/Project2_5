<h1>Santa Monica</h1>
<div class="box"><img src="Santa_Monica1.png"></div>
<p>The first group of people to explore what is known as Santa Monica were the Tongva tribe. Spanish travelers would later discover the area of
Santa Monica during the time missions were being built along the coast. A path would be created that would connect these missions and pass by Santa 
Monica which is known as The Camino Real. In 1872 the land would be purchased and founded by Colonel Baker who traveled from the east coast. 
</p>
<br>
<p>Santa Monica would soon be turned into a popular tourist location as their famous pier recieves 10 million visitors year round.
