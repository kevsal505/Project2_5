<h1>San Francisco</h1>
<div class ="box"><img src="Los_Angeles1.png"></div>
<p>The first people to walk the land of what would be known as San Francisco is the Ohlone tribe which roamed the area at around 500 AD.
In 1776 the Spainards would come in contact with the land and would be founded under the name Yerba Buena, which means
spearmint in English, since there were alot of spearmint plants that would grow in the area. It wasnt until 1846 when the city
would be crowned as San Francisco instead.
</p>
<p>San Francisco would grow into one of California's most populated city, which would be 4th behind LA, San Diego, and San Jose as of 2024 per
<a href ="https://www.california-demographics.com/cities_by_population"> Califonia Demographics </a>. Some historic events would happen in San Francisco
such as the 1906 earthquake which became one of the most devastating earthquakes of all time with the aftermath destorying the city. In 1848, San Francisco
became a key city in the Gold Rush area, where many of travelers came to San Francisco to strike gold. The city is home to one of the most famous prisons called
Alcatraz which was isolated on a island where the most infamos criminals once stayed. The biggest symbol in the city by far is the big red bridge which stretches 
out 1.7 miles that connects the city and Marin county called the Golden Gate bridge.
